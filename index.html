<p>Hi, I'm Mihir. I am a software engineer at NVIDIA, working on compilers for deep learning, targeting GPUs. I graduated from UT Austin with a B.S. in computer science, in the Turing Scholars program.</p>
<p>Overall, I am interested in building systems that leverage novel hardware architectures (CPU, GPU, SmartNIC, programmable switch, etc.) to support modern data-intensive applications (deep learning, databases, etc). I like all areas of systems spanning this area- computer architecture, heterogeneity, compilers, operating systems, databases, low-level networking, etc.</p>
<p>During my B.S., I was in the UT networked systems <a href=https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/>lab</a>, advised by Prof. Aditya Akella. My undergrad <a href=https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/apps/tech-reports/201933>thesis</a> was improving <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00623.pdf>P4DB</a>. P4DB uses the Intel Tofino programmable switch to accelerate a distributed OLTP database. My project was modifying P4DB's database protocols to enable rearranging database interactions with the switch, to improve switch memory utilization by an order of magnitude.
